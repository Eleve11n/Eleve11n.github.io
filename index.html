        <h1> THE PERFECT TRIP</h1>
        <h2><em>CAMBOYA</em></h2>

        <h3>Common Information</h3>
        <p class="CommonInformation">Khmer between the 10th and 14th centuries. This makes it a melting pot for Southeast Asian countries, especially those on the Indochinese Peninsula. Because Thailand has been a more famous country in the West while Cambodia was hidden in the midst of war and conflict, many elements that shaped these other peoples are unknown. For example, the Thai, Lao and other languages of the region have many roots in the older Khmer language. Likewise, pre-Angkorian and Angkorian architecture had a great influence on territories in present-day Thailand, Laos, southern Vietnam, Burma and even Malaysia. Southeast Asian martial arts such as Muay Thai (Thailand), Muay Lao (Laos), Lethwei (Burma) and others have a close origin or influence with the ancient Khmer fighting art known as Bokator (lion splitting) and its more modern expression Prodal Serei (wrestling). <br>
        <br>
Cambodia has greatly improved its tourism infrastructure and is now an easy country to visit, with a modern e-visa and visa-on-arrival service and a large investment in hotels. The people are very friendly, unassuming and each province has its attractions. As its majority religion is Theravada Buddhism, it shares a great deal of cultural similarity with neighbouring Thailand and Laos, as well as regional and cultural integration with southern Vietnam. In Thailand's Surin province and in the southern provinces of Vietnam (Kampuchi Kraom or Lower Cambodia), Khmer ethnic groups are closely related to their Cambodian brethren.
